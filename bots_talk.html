      # Order of the day:

      --

      ###1. Explore a technical problem

      --

      ###2. Discuss attacking that problem with the help of Ruby & Twilio .big[üçñ]

      --

      ###3. Cover outcomes, retrospective observations & how you can get involved

      ???

      more importantly walk you through building a product to solve a problem always thinking about the user first, the ui, the ux, and interactions

      using your coding superpower for good
