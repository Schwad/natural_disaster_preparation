      I am not a twilio expert.

      That's the point.

      Setup was slick and painless.

      Slightly more involved process for Rails integrations but nothing you

      ???

      Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a supervised learning algorithm

      Take in a set of training data of varying types, makes predictions with a set
      of methodologies that someone could probably do a 45 minute talk on themselves.

      Shout out to practicalai.com. With posts under a year old that focus on
      various different real implmentations of ruby against real data using
      different AI techniques

      # Finding the 'best' C and Gamma values

      ???

      C: a larger C will give you lower bias and higher variance a model will have, where a low C will give you high bias and low variance.

      Gamma: defines how far a single training example will have influence
